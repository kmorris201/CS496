Start Up and Dependency Installation

To begin running the website, the following packages will need
to be downloaded: python3, python3-pip, django, django-widget-tweaks.

Python3 and python3-pip should be install through your system package 
manager. Django and django-widget-tweaks should be installed through
the pip3 installer.

If you are using an Ubuntu machine or another Linux distro using the 
apt package manager, installation can be done quickly by running the 
command: sh start_up.sh
