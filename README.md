# CS496
This is a completed project for WKU's Computer Science and Engineering department. 
This is a web application that was developed to solve the problems that commonly arrive when Electrical Engineering students generate simulations and lab reports.
This project was developed using the Django Framework with the Python programming language. This was deployed using two docker containers and was hosted on a remotely accessed raspberry pi 4. 

· Developed a functioning website capable of running electrical engineering lab simulations and automatically generates a lab report. After registering for an account and logging in, the professor can build a unique lab report for student users to download, edit, and submit. 
The student user can also run virtual lab simulations on our web page. 
· The website was developed using an agile prototype approach and implemented on an apache web server, hosted on a raspberry pi 4 inside two docker containers. I implemented Django’s web framework and connected it to a PostgreSQL database using the Python programming language. 
This was developed as a team with Kate Morris acting as both a developer and the project manager, Caleb Kincaid as a developer, Jon Clark as a developer, and Austin White as a developer.
